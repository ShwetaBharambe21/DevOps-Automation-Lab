# 🚀 DevOps Automation Lab

A complete end-to-end DevOps project demonstrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD, containerization, cloud deployment, monitoring, visualization, and alerting on AWS.

This project automates the deployment of a containerized Flask application using **Terraform**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, **Amazon ECS Fargate**, **Amazon ECR**, **Application Load Balancer**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Alertmanager**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a modern DevOps workflow by automating infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, monitoring, and alerting.

The Flask application is containerized using Docker, deployed on Amazon ECS Fargate, exposed through an Application Load Balancer, continuously deployed using GitHub Actions, monitored using Prometheus, visualized in Grafana, and configured with Alertmanager for automated email notifications.
